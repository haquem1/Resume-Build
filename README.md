## Synopsis

This is a POC of an online resume editor and workshop. Server-side environment uses NodeJs and the Express framework.

## To Do

 **Most pressing issues:** Styling of server-side PUG templates needed: columns not translating to PDF conversion
 <p>
Addition of educating users of what makes a good resume before entering the builder is needed. Adding dynamic modals and popups can be implemented to help users edit a given template. Other resume templates can be added as well.
 </p>

*Suggested:* Use of Firebase's to store temporary variable data in PUG templates.

## Installation

To start, download the repository, do an `npm install`
<br/>
To fire up a local dev environment, use `npm run dev`
